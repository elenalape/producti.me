## Why

As a consultant, I bill per hour and need to track my time. I found most available apps to be a total overkill for the simple job. So I spent an hour of my (non-billable) time to make this! 

## Development

Feel free to go crazy and turn this into the next big project management app.

But for starters, run

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Known issues

Doesn't currently work on mobile. This app relies on the browser being able to refresh content every one second... which is unreliable in mobile browsers, unfortunately.
